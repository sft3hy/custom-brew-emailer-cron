President Donald Trump made a brief but enthusiastic appearance at the Daytona 500, soaking up the cheers and patriotic fervor of the NASCAR crowd.  Five years after his first visit to the iconic race, Trump praised the drivers, reveled in the spectacle of the event, and praised  NASCAR as "Trump country."  This latest outing comes amidst a surge in Trump's polling numbers and a successful cabinet confirmation process,  further bolstering his second term, which has, thus far, earned more favor than his first.

Trump's visit provided a platform for celebration and display of support. "Let's go, Brandon" flags flew, some RVs were decked out with Trump banners side by side American flags, and chants for the former president echoed through the speedway.  This strong showing mirrored Trump's well-documented affinity for professional sports and athletes, which he views as a source of spectacle and proximity to power.

While the race was quickly delayed by rain, cutting Trump's visit short, his presence highlighted the deep political divides that extend even to the realm of beloved sporting events. Trump supporters at Daytona saw him as a champion fighting on their behalf,  while critics argue his penchant for showcasing himself at sporting events serves only to further inflame partisan tensions.

At just 25 years old, reigning PGA TOUR champion Ludvig Åberg continues to impress the golf world. Fresh off a knee surgery recovery, Åberg returned to the TOUR with a  new club in tow: Titleist's GT2 driver. While he switched back to his trusty TSR2 for the final round of the Torrey Pines event, the new GT2 helped him find  success.  

The victory wasn't just a product of his driving, though. Åberg further honed his game by switching to the 2025 Pro V1x golf ball,  working closely with Titleist's director of Tour Validation and Research. This combination of  refined equipment and focused practice allowed  Åberg to conquer a challenging course, overcoming back-to-back bogeys with a blistering six birdies in the final 14 holes.  This dominant finish earned him a one-stroke victory over Maverick McNealy.

In a roaring Madison Square Garden, the St. John's Red Storm secured a thrilling 79-73 victory over the Creighton Bluejays, putting them in the driver's seat to win their first outright Big East regular season title since 1985. Led by a stellar performance from RJ Luis (23 points, 14 rebounds, 5 assists) and a tenacious defensive effort, the Johnnies overcame Creighton's early second-half lead and turned 15 turnovers into 20 points. 

Despite shooting just 38 percent from the field and missing 12 free throws, St. John's (22-4, 13-2) battled through adversity, showcasing their trademark resilience with another impressive win. The victory extends their winning streak and establishes them as a dominant force in the Big East,  two games ahead of Creighton and Marquette.  "It defies all statistical logic, but that tells you how good they are with effort," Coach Rick Pitino praised his team, highlighting their incredible winning record despite defying traditional statistical expectations. 


While the victory sends a powerful message to the rest of the conference, the Red Storm remain grounded, knowing five games remain in the season.  As star player Kadary Richmond noted,  "We can't have any slipups." The Johnnies will need to maintain their focus and determination to secure the historic championship.
