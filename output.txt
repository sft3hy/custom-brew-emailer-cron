The couple, radiant in silver and tuxedo attire, radiated joy and laughter as they faced the cameras, seemingly unfazed by the surrounding drama.</p>\n            <p>The appearance comes after Lively filed a lawsuit alleging sexual harassment and a "hostile work environment" by director Justin Baldoni during the filming of "It Ends With Us."  Baldoni has vehemently denied the claims and filed counter-suits against Lively, Reynolds, and others involved. A heated legal battle ensues, with Lively accusing Baldoni\'s team of orchestrated smear campaign, and Baldoni accusing the media of spreading false information.</p>\n            <p>Reynolds,  making a brief appearance during the SNL anniversary special, lightheartedly addressed questions about his well-being, adding a touch of playful defiance to the evening. The trial date is set for March 2026, but for now,  Lively and Reynolds stand united, putting on a united front on one of Hollywood\'s biggest nights.</p>\n            <p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/16/entertainment/blake-lively-ryan-reynolds-snl/index.html" target="_blank">Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds step out for â€˜SNLâ€™ 50th anniversary special amid Justin Baldoni legal battle - Yahoo Entertainment</a></p>\n            <hr>\n            <h2><strong>"SNL at 50: Simon & Carpenter Kickstart the Legendary Celebration"</strong></h2>\n            <p>Forget the birthday candles this time â€“ "Saturday Night Live" turned the big 5-0 with a dazzling opening performance by music icons Paul Simon and Sabrina Carpenter.

His album "GNX" reclaims the top spot for its second week, propelled by increased sales and streaming numbers after its physical release. "GNX" now boasts three albums in the top 10, marking the first time a solo male artist has achieved this feat since Herb Alpert in 1966.</p>\n            <p>This chart success stems from Lamar\'s performance, which reignited interest in his discography. "DAMN.", his 2017 chart-topper, jumps 29-9, while "good kid, m.A.A.d city" returns to the top 10 at number 10.  The surge in demand for Lamar\'s music is particularly noteworthy for "GNX," with physical album sales, especially vinyl, seeing record-breaking numbers.</p>\n            <p>Other artists who shared the spotlight with Lamar during the halftime show, such as SZA, also benefitted from the exposure, with her album "SOS" climbing to number 2 on the chart. The success of Lamar\'s Super Bowl performance demonstrates the enduring power of live performances to elevate an artist\'s music and engage fans on a deeper level.</p>\n            <p><a href="http://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/kendrick-lamar-gnx-returns-number-one-billboard-200-super-bowl-1235903744/" target="_blank">Kendrick Lamarâ€™s â€˜GNXâ€™ Returns to No. 1 on Billboard 200 Chart - Billboard</a></p>\n        </div>\n        <div class="footer">\n            Entertainment News - please verify facts.\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>', 'Business': '<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <meta charset="UTF-8">\n    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">\n    <title>Newsletter</title>\n    <style>\n        body {\n            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;\n            margin: 0;\n            padding: 0;\n            background-color: #f4f4f4;\n        }\n        .container {\n            max-width: 600px;\n            background: #ffffff;\n            padding: 5px;\n            border-radius: 8px;\n            box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n        }\n        .header {\n            background: #007bff;\n            color: #ffffff;\n            text-align: center;\n            padding: 20px;\n            font-size: 24px;\n            font-weight: bold;\n            border-radius: 8px 8px 0 0;\n        }\n        .content {\n            padding: 20px;\n            color: #333;\n            line-height: 1.6;\n            border: 2px solid #ccc;\n            border-radius: 0 0 8px 8px;\n        }\n        .footer {\n            text-align: center;\n            font-size: 12px;\n            color: #777;\n            padding: 20px;\n            border-top: 1px solid #ddd;\n            margin-top: 20px;\n        }\n        hr {\n            border: none; /* Remove default border */\n            border-top: 1px solid #ccc; /* Thin solid grey line */\n            margin: 20px 0; /* Add spacing above and below */\n        }\n        @media screen and (max-width: 600px) {\n            .container {\n                margin: auto;\n            }\n        }\n    </style>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div class="container">\n        <div class="header">Custom Newsletter</div>\n        <div class="content">\n            <h2>Bitcoin Consolidates Near $97,000: Key Levels to Watch</h2>\n            <p>Bitcoin\'s price remains stable around the $97,000 mark, showing resilience despite minor fluctuations. Although recent on-chain data and technical indicators suggest Bitcoin is in a strong position, key support and resistance levels will dictate its next move.</p>\n            <p>The MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) extreme deviation pricing bands indicate that Bitcoin might be poised for further upside, currently trading near the +1.0 band, which historically signals strong price momentum.

This cutting-edge computer system, seamlessly integrated into the Vision Driving Experience (VDX) concept car, combines driving dynamics and powertrain control into a single unit. During a test drive with BMW engineers, the VDX, equipped with the Heart of Joy, showcased impressive performance, offering lightning-fast acceleration and remarkably smooth regenerative braking.</p>\n            <p>The Heart of Joy, a result of three years of intensive development and over 7,500 hours of testing, represents a departure from industry norms. While most automakers rely on external suppliers for their ECUs, BMW chose to develop this system in-house, giving them greater control over the driving experience and allowing them to tailor it specifically to their brand identity. This in-house development also allows for more efficient over-the-air updates, keeping BMW EVs at the forefront of technological advancements.</p>\n            <p>BMW believes the Heart of Joy will allow them to create a truly unique electric driving experience, distinct from competitors. By integrating driving dynamics and powertrain control, the system optimizes performance and efficiency, resulting in a more engaging and dynamic drive. Furthermore, the system\'s ability to control individual wheels and shift power distribution enhances stability and deceleration, amplifying the "joy of stopping." BMW sees this singular focus on in-house development as a key differentiator, especially with the increasing push for regionalization in the automotive industry.</p>\n            <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/cars/613962/bme-heart-of-joy-ecu-ev-powertrain-drive-dynamics" target="_blank">BMWâ€™s next-gen EVs depend on an unassuming black box called â€˜Heart of Joyâ€™ - The Verge</a></p>\n            <hr>\n            <p>Please provide the article you would like me to summarize.
