            <p><p> Pope Francis is continuing his treatment for pneumonia in a Roman hospital and was reportedly comfortable overnight, though still in a “critical” condition. The 88-year-old pontiff experienced an "asthmatic respiratory crisis" and is receiving supplemental oxygen. He has been advised to rest and did not deliver the Angelus prayer for the third time in his papacy.</p><p>The Vatican has shared occasional updates on Francis' health, stating that he is alert and able to communicate, but experiencing more pain than on previous days. In his Sunday sermon, shared in advance, he expressed gratitude for the medical staff’s care and asked for prayers for peace in war-torn regions.  </p><p>Despite requiring further medical attention, Francis has kept up some duties, including phone calls with his assistants in Gaza. He will break a record for his longest hospital stay upon Monday. </p><p></p><p></p> <a href='https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/21/europe/pope-francis-rome-hospital-pneumonia-one-week-intl/index.html' target="_blank">Pope is in ‘critical’ condition after suffering ‘asthmatic respiratory crisis,’ Vatican says - CNN</a><br></p><hr><h2>Can Arabs stop Trump’s Gaza displacement proposal? - Al Jazeera English</h2>

            <p><p>President Trump's controversial proposal to relocate Palestinians from Gaza and build a new tourist destination has sparked outrage globally. The idea, which involves relocating over two million Palestinians to countries like Jordan and Egypt,  has been met with fierce criticism from the international community and outright rejection from Arab nations.</p><p>Despite a meeting of Gulf nations, Egypt, and Jordan, no concrete alternative proposals emerged. While a follow-up meeting is scheduled for Cairo,  it remains unclear if this will be enough to change Trump's stance.  </p><p>
The debate surrounding Trump's proposal raises critical questions about the future of Gaza and the potential for peace in the region.

                </div>
            <p><p>Trump administration's actions have stalled biomedical research in America. NIH has been blocked from announcing meetings in the Federal Register, hindering the process of selecting and funding new science projects. This delay means grant money is not reaching researchers, potentially leading to project halts, lab closures, and job losses.</p><p>Grant funding delays are costing the scientific community dearly. Even a six-month delay can have devastating consequences for laboratories, graduate students, and ultimately, the progress of scientific discovery. Vital research into areas like Parkinson's disease, cancer, and addiction could be put on hold, impacting the potential for breakthroughs and cures.</p><p>The repercussions of these delays extend beyond immediate funding challenges. The disruption to the scientific process and the uncertainty surrounding future funding make it difficult to recruit and retain young researchers, hindering the growth and innovation of the field. This unprecedented downsizing of federal investment in science could have long-lasting consequences for the progress of biomedical research in the United States.  </p><p>

            <p><p>Israel has delayed the release of 620 Palestinian prisoners, initially scheduled for Saturday after the handover of six Israeli hostages. This decision came as a shock to families who were eagerly awaiting the prisoners' return.  Israel stated the delay was due to "ceremonies that demean the dignity of our hostages" during the handover of the previous six captives.</p><p>The Palestinian Authority confirmed the delay, and families, who had waited outside Ofer prison in freezing temperatures, were visibly disappointed.  Hamas, meanwhile, accused Israel of violating the ceasefire agreement and stalling the release of the prisoners.</p><p>The situation further complicates the fragile truce between Israel and Hamas. Negotiations for the second phase of the ceasefire are yet to begin, and the looming release of four more bodies and the remaining hostages create a tense atmosphere.  The path towards a lasting peace remains uncertain.  </p><p></p><p></p> <a href='https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-ceasefire-hostages-02-22-2025-364c7abeb679e910cb5acba234469574' target="_blank">Hamas frees 6 hostages but questions cloud Gaza ceasefire’s future - The Associated Press</a><br></p><hr><h2>Warren Buffett celebrates Berkshire Hathaway's success over 60 years as CEO while admitting mistakes - The Associated Press</h2>
