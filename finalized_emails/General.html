            <p><p>Microsoft has announced Majorana 1, the world's first quantum chip built using a novel Topological Core architecture. This breakthrough leverages topoconductors, a new type of material that can produce stable and scalable qubits, the building blocks of quantum computers.</p><p>Majorana 1 utilizes unique Majorana particles to achieve greater qubit stability and control, making it more resistant to environmental disruptions. This digital control method simplifies quantum computing and paves the way for scaling to a million qubits, a crucial milestone for tackling complex real-world problems.  </p><p>This advancement positions Microsoft to provide solutions in areas like materials science, healthcare, and energy by enabling the design and optimization of materials and molecules that are currently beyond the reach of classical computers. The company envisions a future where quantum computers can assist in developing self-healing materials, breaking down microplastics, and optimizing enzyme behavior for improved food production.</p><p>

            <p><p>Firefly Aerospace's lunar lander, Blue Ghost, has successfully entered lunar orbit and is preparing to touch down on the moon's surface on March 2nd.  After a four-day journey from Earth, Blue Ghost completed a crucial engine burn, lowering its orbit to 75 miles above the moon. Firefly's team is meticulously analyzing data and fine-tuning the lander's descent in anticipation of the landing.</p><p>This mission, known as "Ghost Riders in the Sky," is part of NASA's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) which aims to utilize private companies for moon exploration. Blue Ghost carries ten NASA experiments and technologies designed to study the lunar environment, contributing valuable data to the Artemis program's goal of returning astronauts to the moon.</p><p>Launching alongside Blue Ghost was Japan's ispace lunar lander "Resilience," which is also aiming for a soft landing but with a different path and a timeline extending to June.  If successful, Blue Ghost will become the second private mission to land on the moon, paving the way for further commercial lunar exploration. </p><p></p><p></p> <a href='https://www.space.com/space-exploration/launches-spacecraft/blue-ghost-moon-lander-lowers-its-orbit-to-fly-closer-to-the-lunar-surface-video' target="_blank">Blue Ghost moon lander lowers its orbit to fly closer to the lunar surface (video) - Space.com</a><br></p><hr><h2>Trump suggests 25% tariffs on autos, pharma and semiconductors that could go even higher - CNBC</h2>

            <p><p>President Trump has announced plans to potentially widen the scope of U.S. tariffs, potentially impacting industries like automobiles, pharmaceuticals, and semiconductors.  Trump stated that these tariffs, around 25% initially, could rise over the course of a year and may commence as early as April 2nd. </p><p>This move represents a significant escalation in the administration's trade policies, which already include tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. While the new tariffs might affect imports from various countries, including Mexico, Japan, and Canada, Trump believes they will encourage companies to move manufacturing operations back to the United States. </p><p>However, these potential tariffs could also increase drug prices, exacerbate drug shortages, and force pharmaceutical companies to explore alternative markets, according to Ophelia Chan, a senior business fundamentals analyst at GlobalData.  </p><p></p><p></p> <a href='https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/19/trump-suggests-25percent-tariffs-on-autos-pharma-and-semiconductors-that-could-go-even-higher.html' target="_blank">Trump suggests 25% tariffs on autos, pharma and semiconductors that could go even higher - CNBC</a><br></p><hr><h2>Webb telescope spies the Milky Way’s black hole constantly ‘bubbling’ with light - CNN</h2>

                </div>
            <p><p>Astronomers using the James Webb Space Telescope have witnessed impressive displays of light flares near the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy, the Milky Way. </p><p>These flares, both short bursts and longer, brighter flashes, occur constantly and appear to be random in nature, making for a dynamic and unpredictable observation. The flares are believed to originate from the accretion disk – a swirling disk of gas and dust – that orbits Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the Milky Way's central black hole.</p><p>This ongoing observation provides valuable insights into the behavior of black holes and how they influence their surroundings. Astronomers hope to gather more data to understand the mechanisms behind these flares and the black hole's overall activity.
