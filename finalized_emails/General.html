            <p><p>)</p><p>The US government is undergoing a major restructuring under President Trump's direction, aiming to reduce the federal workforce and eliminate positions. The administration has set a deadline for agencies to submit plans for downsizing, consolidating programs, and increasing efficiency. Despite resistance from labor unions and Democrats, who argue that this move will hinder government services, the administration views it as a necessary cost-saving measure.</p><p>Thousands of probationary employees have already been let go, and now the focus is on career officials with civil service protection. Senior officials, including Trump, claim the government is "bloated" and "sloppy," and that this change will improve its efficiency. However, critics worry that this will lead to extensive changes in government functions and result in crippling workforce reductions.</p><p>Agencies have until March 13 to submit their plans, which will include reducing staff and eliminating positions. More detailed plans are due on April 14, and officials stress that this initiative is backed by congressional approval.</p> <a href='https://apnews.com/article/trump-elon-musk-federal-workers-layoffs-d295d4bb2cdd5023c27d9cb03754e81b' target="_blank">The Trump administration sets the stage for large-scale federal worker layoffs in a new memo - The Associated Press</a><br></p><hr><h2>Earth dodges ‘city-killer’ asteroid — but Nasa says the Moon might not be so lucky - The Times of India</h2>
