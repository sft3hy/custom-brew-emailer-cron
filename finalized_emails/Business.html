The wrap ad, featuring a picture of the White House superimposed over Musk, was ultimately rejected by the Post with no explanation.  </p><p>Common Cause was informed that the paper would not run the wrap ad despite having already signed a contract. When they inquired about possible revisions, the Post simply stated it couldn't publish the ad.  As a result, Common Cause decided to withdraw their smaller interior ad as well, expressing concern about the Post's willingness to challenge powerful figures.</p><p>
The decision by the Post, owned by Jeff Bezos, has raised questions about corporate influence on the media and its commitment to investigative journalism. The incident comes at a time when the free press faces increasing challenges, including censorship by the Trump administration. 
 This situation highlights the delicate balance between protecting journalistic integrity and avoiding censorship while navigating the complex relationship between media outlets, advertisers, and political figures. </p><p></p><p>

Demonstrations were primarily peaceful, taking place outside Tesla showrooms in major cities like Minneapolis and Manhattan. </p><p>While most protests remained lawful, some instances of vandalism involving anti-fascist graffiti on Tesla storefronts occurred. </p><p>Support groups like Anonymous plan to continue pressuring Tesla and Musk, hoping to force a change in the company's direction. This public pressure comes as Tesla's sales decline, particularly in Europe, and internal dissent over Musk's leadership grows. </p><p>
Employees and senior managers have privately expressed concerns about Musk's potential harm to Tesla's sustainability mission and brand image, with some suggesting his resignation would be beneficial.</p><p> Although some employees are voicing their dissent, fear of retaliation and company monitoring limits open criticism within Tesla. With the board of directors remaining silent on these concerns, it remains unclear if this internal pushback will lead to any meaningful change.

Grok 3 boasts improved capabilities thanks to a new approach to training, allowing it to access real-time information and adapt its responses accordingly.  </p><p>Elon Musk has highlighted Grok 3's impressive performance, claiming it already outperforms its competitors.  The update includes self-correction, reinforcement learning, and synthetic datasets, accelerating Grok's learning process like Tesla's refinement of Full Self-Driving (FSD).</p><p>One eagerly anticipated addition is voice support, a feature missing from Grok's previous versions. This is particularly relevant for Tesla, as Grok is slated to power the upcoming voice assistant in their vehicles.</p><p>Tesla plans to integrate Grok as a Smart Voice Assistant, far surpassing the current voice command system.  This means drivers can ask more complex questions, control the vehicle in a more natural way, and even leverage Grok's real-time capabilities to add stops to their routes or check the weather.</p><p>The February 17th demo is expected to showcase Grok integrated with Tesla vehicles, potentially revealing a wake word like "Grok" for activating the assistant.  Millions of Tesla drivers worldwide could soon benefit from Grok's advanced AI. </p><p>
