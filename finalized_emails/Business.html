            <p><p> </p><p>Elon Musk's companies have received billions of dollars in government support over the past two decades, helping seed the growth of his business empire. Since becoming CEO of Tesla in 2008, Musk has received a $465 million loan from the Energy Department, which helped fuel the company's rapid expansion. NASA and the Defense Department have also provided significant funding to SpaceX, with the National Reconnaissance Office awarding the company a $1.8 billion contract for spy satellites.</p><p>Musk's businesses have benefited from government programs aimed at boosting the electric-car industry, with Tesla earning $11.4 billion in regulatory credits and receiving a federal $7,500 tax credit for EV buyers. The company has also received billions in state and local government incentives, including a $1.3 billion package in Nevada to build a lithium battery "gigafactory." </p><p>Musk has been a vocal advocate for slashing subsidies across industries, but many experts argue that his companies have benefited disproportionately from government funding. "It's not a weird phenomenon for Tesla to benefit from this, but it is certainly hypocritical," said John Helveston, a professor at George Washington University.</p> <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2025/elon-musk-business-government-contracts-funding/' target="_blank">Elon Musk’s business empire is built on $38 billion in government funding - The Washington Post</a><br></p><hr><h2>Stock market today: Wall Street climbs and heads for its first gain in 5 days - The Associated Press</h2>

The company's data center segment, which includes GPU sales, saw a significant increase, driven by growing demand for its hardware.</p><p>Despite concerns about Chinese AI company DeepSeek's lower-cost AI model, Nvidia's demand for its high-end chips remains strong, with CEO Jensen Huang calling the demand for its Blackwell GPU "extraordinary". The chipmaker also gave upbeat guidance for the first quarter, predicting $43 billion in revenue. Nvidia's gross margin is under pressure due to the production ramp of Blackwell, but the company expects it to increase to the mid-70% range later in the year.</p><p>Nvidia's stock saw volatile after-hours trading following the earnings release, but the stock is now trading up over 2% in after-hours trading.

            <p><p>AppLovin, a leading tech firm, saw its stock price plummet 12% on Wednesday after two short sellers cast doubt on the integrity of its AI-powered advertising software, AXON.</p><p>The reports, from Fuzzy Panda and Culper Research, claimed that AppLovin was using manipulative tactics to drive advertising revenue, including stealing data from other companies and exploiting consumers. This criticism comes after the company's stellar fourth-quarter earnings beat, which showed a 73% increase in advertising revenue to nearly $1 billion.</p><p>AppLovin's CEO, Adam Foroughi, responded to the short sellers' claims, stating that the reports were full of inaccuracies and aimed at undermining the company's success for financial gain. The company has already announced plans to spin off its mobile gaming segments and expand the AXON model to other e-commerce sectors, which has contributed to its 700% surge in stock price in 2024.</p><p>Whether these claims have any merit remains to be seen, but AppLovin's stock price has certainly taken a hit.</p><p> </p><p>The company's explosive growth has been fueled by the AI boom and a growth in online advertising. Its advertising revenue climbed an impressive 73% in the quarter to reach almost $1 billion, but for now, it seems that its success has been overshadowed by doubts over the integrity of its software.</p> <a href='https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/26/applovin-shares-tumble-as-short-sellers-target-axon-ad-software.html' target="_blank">AppLovin shares tumble 13% as short sellers question its centerpiece AXON ad software - CNBC</a><br></p><hr></div>
