            <p><p>HSBC, Europe's largest lender, announced a $2 billion share buyback after reporting a 6.5% increase in annual pre-tax profit. This boost was largely driven by the sale of its Canadian banking business.  While revenue dipped slightly compared to 2022,  pre-tax profit exceeded analysts' initial expectations.  </p><p>The bank's fourth-quarter profit nearly doubled from the previous year,  recovering from a substantial impairment charge. HSBC plans to complete the share buyback by the end of their first quarter in 2025.</p><p>In an effort to streamline operations, HSBC aims to reduce costs by $1.5 billion annually by 2026. This aligns with their ongoing reorganization strategy, which divides the bank into four distinct units focused on "Eastern" and "Western" markets.  </p><p>

            <p><p>KFC, the iconic fried chicken chain, is leaving its Kentucky roots behind. Yum Brands, the parent company, announced the move of its corporate headquarters from Louisville to Plano, Texas.  While KFC will retain some operations in Kentucky, including its foundation, the company cited a desire for "sustainable growth" and better serving its customers and stakeholders as reasons for the relocation.  </p><p>Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear expressed disappointment over the decision, believing that founder Colonel Harland Sanders would share his sentiment. Beshear pointed out that KFC's name is intrinsically linked to Kentucky's heritage and culture, which has been prominently featured in the brand's marketing. </p><p>This move is part of Yum Brands' larger strategy to create two headquarters for its main brands. KFC and Pizza Hut will be based in Plano, while Taco Bell and Habit Burger & Grill remain in Irvine, California.  Many companies have been relocating to Texas in recent years, attracted by the state's lower taxes and business-friendly environment.     </p><p></p><p>
