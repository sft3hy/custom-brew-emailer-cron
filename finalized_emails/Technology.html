While the company didn't elaborate on why "Trump" was associated with the word "racist," the incident occurred amid tensions between Apple and Trump.</p><p>Trump claimed credit for Apple's recent $500 billion investment in the US, but  criticized the company after its shareholders rejected a proposal to end diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.  </p><p>
