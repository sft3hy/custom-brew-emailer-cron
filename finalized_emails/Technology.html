            <p><p>This week in tech saw the shocking demise of Humane's AI Pin, acquired by HP for a mere fraction of its previous valuation.  Humane will cease hardware sales and server support for the $499 device, leaving existing users stranded.</p><p>Meanwhile, HP sweetened the pot for some Humane employees with lucrative offers, while others faced immediate job losses. The shaken tech landscape also saw Apple unveil its much-anticipated iPhone SE refresh, featuring an A18 chip, Face ID, and the shift to USB-C. </p><p>The week wasn’t all about hardware though, with Duolingo's marketing stunt of "killing" its iconic owl mascot trending. OpenAI announced "uncensored" ChatGPT, aiming for neutrality even on controversial topics, while Uber engaged in a legal battle with DoorDash, accusing its rival of anti-competitive practices.</p><p></p><p>

            <p><p>After years of delays, Spotify's oft-delayed HiFi feature is finally on its way, expected to launch in the coming months as part of a new "Music Pro" package.  Once envisioned as a simple lossless audio upgrade, Spotify HiFi faced numerous hurdles, including competition from Apple Music and Amazon Music, as well as licensing challenges.  With rivals offering high-quality audio at no extra cost, Spotify pivoted, deciding to bundle HiFi with additional features to create a truly premium experience.  </p><p></p><p>Music Pro is rumored to include perks like early-access concert tickets, DJ remix tools, and even speaker/headphone optimization. Spotify may also add user account options and karaoke features, aiming to make the package a compelling alternative to existing subscription tiers.  </p><p>However, Spotify's full plans for Music Pro remain unclear, as the company intends to roll it out gradually, incorporating new features throughout 2025. CEO Daniel Ek has hinted at a richer, more customizable experience for music lovers, hoping to attract subscribers with "all of the benefits" of a standard Spotify Premium account plus added value and control.</p><p>     </p><p></p><p></p> <a href='https://www.theverge.com/spotify/617927/spotify-hifi-music-pro-coming-2025' target="_blank">Spotify HiFi was announced four years ago, and it’s almost here — maybe - The Verge</a><br></p><hr><h2>The iPhone 16e proves we do need Qualcomm for 5G in North America - Android Central</h2>

                </div>
            <p><p>Apple is launching a new budget iPhone, the 16e, which features its own in-house 5G modem, the C1.  While this move signals Apple's desire to reduce reliance on Qualcomm, the C1 lacks support for millimeter-wave 5G frequencies. This means the iPhone 16e won't have access to the fastest 5G speeds available and coverage in some areas may be limited. </p><p>The C1's lack of millimeter-wave support highlights the dominance of Qualcomm in the 5G landscape. Despite Apple's considerable resources, it appears they couldn't overcome the challenges of licensing or developing a competing millimeter-wave modem technology.</p><p>Apple states that the C1 will be incorporated into other iPhone models in the future. It's likely they will integrate millimeter-wave functionality before that happens to ensure their iPhones remain competitive in terms of network performance.</p><p></p><p>

                </div>
            <p><p>Microsoft researchers have made a potential breakthrough in quantum computing with the creation of the first "topological qubits." These qubits, based on exotic particles called Majorana fermions, are designed to be incredibly stable and resistant to errors, a major hurdle in building practical quantum computers. </p><p>The Majorana 1 processor, their prototype, boasts the potential to hold up to a million qubits. This immense capacity could allow for significant advancements in fields like cryptography, drug discovery, and materials science.  </p><p>While this announcement is highly promising, independent verification is still needed. Moreover, there are some limitations, such as the inability to perform one particular operation without introducing errors. Nevertheless, Microsoft's approach with topological qubits offers a potentially revolutionary path forward in the quest for powerful quantum computing capabilities.  </p><p>
