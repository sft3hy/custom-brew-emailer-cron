            <p><p>Microsoft has achieved a major breakthrough in quantum computing with the unveiling of Majorana 1, the world’s first quantum chip powered by a new Topological Core architecture.  This architecture utilizes a special type of material called a topoconductor, which enables the creation of Majorana particles. These particles are incredibly stable and resistant to errors, a key challenge for building reliable quantum computers.</p><p>Majorana 1's design paves the way for developing quantum computers capable of solving complex problems in fields like chemistry, materials science, and healthcare. The chip, which fits in the palm of your hand, could eventually contain a million qubits, the building blocks of quantum computation, allowing for unprecedented computational power.  This advancement moves us closer to realizing the potential of quantum computing for tackling real-world challenges.</p><p>Compared to previous approaches, Microsoft's Topological Core offers a significant advantage in scalability and controllability. </p><p>
  The ability to manipulate and measure Majorana particles digitally simplifies the quantum computing process and opens the door to building larger, more powerful quantum systems.  With Majorana 1, Microsoft is taking a giant leap towards a future where quantum computers can revolutionize various industries and scientific disciplines. </p><p></p><p></p> <a href='https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/microsofts-majorana-1-chip-carves-new-path-for-quantum-computing/' target="_blank">Microsoft’s Majorana 1 chip carves new path for quantum computing - Microsoft</a><br></p><hr><h2>Microsoft’s Xbox AI era starts with a model that can generate gameplay - The Verge</h2>

            <p><p>Niantic, the developer of the popular mobile game Pokémon Go, is reportedly in discussions to sell its video game division to Saudi-owned Scopely for $3.5 billion. This potential deal, if finalized, could see Pokémon Go become part of Scopely's expanding portfolio, which already includes hit titles like The Walking Dead: Road to Survival and Stumble Guys.  While the agreement isn't finalized, sources suggest it could be confirmed within weeks.</p><p>Neither Niantic nor Scopely has publicly confirmed the reported acquisition. This move comes after Savvy Games Group, owned by the Saudi Arabian government, purchased Scopely in April 2023 for $4.9 billion as part of a broader strategy to establish Saudi Arabia as a global leader in the gaming and esports industry by 2030. </p><p>Savvy Games Group also acquired ESL and FACEIT, two major esports companies, in 2022 as part of their ambitious plans. The potential acquisition of Niantic's game division would further cement Savvy's position in the gaming world.</p><p></p> <a href='https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-go-developer-niantic-reportedly-in-talks-to-sell-video-game-business-to-saudi-owned-company-behind-stumble-guys' target="_blank">Pokémon Go Developer Niantic Reportedly in Talks to Sell Video Game Business to Saudi-Owned Company Behind Stumble Guys - IGN</a><br></p><hr><h2>Google is giving away even more personal data in exchange for profits - BGR</h2>

                </div>
            <p><p>Google's decision to allow advertisers to use user-tracking technology known as fingerprinting, effective February 16th, has sparked controversy.  Despite prior bans and claims of prioritizing user privacy, Google is now enabling advertisers to collect data such as IP addresses, operating system details, and screen resolution to create user profiles and target them with personalized ads. This technique, likened to "tracking without consent" by regulators, raises concerns about user control over their data and potential privacy violations.</p><p>The UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) strongly criticized Google's move, labeling it a breach of user expectations and a return to practices they previously deemed "wrong."  The ICO emphasizes that fingerprinting bypasses user consent and control, making it an unfair tracking method. </p><p>Furthermore, the timing of Google's announcement, just before Christmas, suggests an attempt to minimize public scrutiny.  The ICO is urging businesses using fingerprinting to comply with data protection laws and obtain user consent, including transparency and the right to erasure. This policy change raises significant questions about Google's commitment to user privacy and its willingness to prioritize profits over ethical data practices.  </p><p></p><p></p> <a href='https://bgr.com/tech/google-is-giving-away-even-more-personal-data-in-exchange-for-profits/' target="_blank">Google is giving away even more personal data in exchange for profits - BGR</a><br></p><hr><h2>Google Tasks is now its own website - 9to5Google</h2>

            <p><p>Google has launched a standalone website for its Google Tasks app.</p><p>Previously, Tasks could only be accessed through calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/tasks or from the Workspace sidebar in other apps. The new website, Tasks.google.com, offers the same full-screen Tasks interface seen in Google Calendar, but without the calendar redirect. </p><p>The UI is virtually identical to the calendar version, with lists appearing as re-arrangeable cards and a navigation drawer for managing tasks. This change mirrors Google's approach on Android where both a standalone Tasks app and an integrated calendar experience exist.  </p><p>
