                </div>
            <p><p>A recent study conducted by Italian researchers investigated factors influencing how well people remember their dreams.  They found that  dream recall isn't random, but influenced by factors like personal attitudes towards dreams, cognitive traits like daydreaming, and even the time of year.</p><p>The study, which involved over 200 participants,  revealed interesting connections between dream recall and various factors.  For example, people who viewed dreams positively and were prone to daydreaming had better dream recall.</p><p>Additionally, lighter sleep stages and being younger were linked to increased dream recall, while older participants often felt they had dreamt but couldn't remember the details. This phenomenon, termed "white dreams," suggests actual dream experiences occur but the memories fade upon waking. </p><p></p><p>

            <p><p>A new long-term study suggests that eating just two servings of yogurt per week may help protect against a specific type of colorectal cancer.</p><p>Researchers analyzed data from over 130,000 people and found that those who consumed yogurt regularly were 20% less likely to have a tumor containing Bifidobacterium bacteria, a type often associated with aggressive colorectal cancer. This benefit was particularly pronounced for proximal colon tumors, which are more difficult to treat and have a poorer prognosis.</p><p>While more research is needed to confirm these findings, the study adds to growing evidence suggesting a link between diet, gut health, and colon cancer risk. The focus on yogurt and its influence on Bifidobacterium levels opens up exciting avenues for further investigation into how dietary choices can impact our health.</p><p></p><p></p> <a href='https://www.sciencealert.com/yogurt-shows-great-potential-against-colon-cancer-study-reveals' target="_blank">Yogurt Shows Great Potential Against Colon Cancer, Study Reveals - ScienceAlert</a><br></p><hr><h2>Ohio records first juvenile flu-related death as hospitalizations continue to rise - Dayton Daily News</h2>

            <p><p>Flu activity is surging in Ohio, with hospitalizations significantly exceeding the five-year average. In the recent week, there were 2,470 flu-related hospitalizations statewide, a 25.8% jump from the previous week.  This is a stark contrast to the typical 5-year average of less than 500 hospitalizations for this time of year.</p><p>Health officials are urging the public to take precautions as flu season peaks. Influenza A, the dominant strain this year, is causing more severe illness than type B. Early vaccination is still recommended, and good hygiene practices like frequent handwashing and staying home when sick can help curb the spread.  </p><p>Hospitals are seeing an influx of patients, emphasizing the seriousness of the situation.  To avoid overwhelming emergency rooms, individuals with flu-like symptoms are encouraged to seek care through alternative channels like urgent care centers or telehealth appointments.   </p><p>

            <p><p>We're currently experiencing a surge in norovirus cases, commonly known as the "stomach bug." This year is seeing double the usual number of cases compared to previous years, with symptoms peaking between November and April. </p><p>Norovirus is highly contagious and spreads easily through contaminated food, water, and surfaces. Symptoms typically appear within 12 to 48 hours of exposure and include vomiting and diarrhea, along with nausea, stomach cramps, and possible fatigue. </p><p>It's crucial to practice meticulous handwashing and disinfect surfaces to prevent the spread. Staying hydrated is essential for recovery, as norovirus often leads to dehydration.  If symptoms persist or worsen, consult a doctor, especially if you are elderly, immunocompromised, or a young child. </p><p>

            <p><p>Several food categories pose a higher risk for bacterial contamination and require extra caution during storage. Experts recommend paying special attention to high-protein foods like meat, fish, poultry, eggs, and dairy products, as well as ready-to-eat meats and smoked fish.</p><p>While refrigeration can slow bacterial growth, it doesn't eliminate it entirely. It is essential to store perishable foods promptly after cooking and consume them within 24 hours. Cooked rice, in particular, needs to be stored properly to prevent the growth of Bacillus cereus spores. </p><p>Don't rely solely on your senses to determine food safety, as some harmful bacteria won't alter the smell, taste, or appearance.  Remember, when in doubt, throw it out. Properly labeling and dating food items can help prevent confusion and minimize food waste. </p><p></p><p></p> <a href='https://www.buzzfeed.com/juliekendrick/most-dangerous-foods-in-refrigerator' target="_blank">These Are The Most Dangerous Foods In Your Refrigerator, According To Foodborne Illness Experts - Yahoo Life</a><br></p><hr><h2>The dangers of drinking: Experts explain the 4 ways alcohol can cause cancer - Fortune</h2>
