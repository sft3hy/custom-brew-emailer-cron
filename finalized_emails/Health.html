            <p><p>|</p><p>A child in rural West Texas has died from measles, the first US death from the highly contagious disease in nearly a decade. The outbreak, which has seen 124 cases across nine counties, has made Texas' largest in nearly 30 years. The child, who wasn't identified, was treated at Covenant Children's Hospital in Lubbock and had a rash of the disease.</p><p>Federal response has been slower, with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. misstating facts about the outbreak, saying that most hospitalizations were due to quarantine. However, experts have clarified that hospitalizations were for supportive care, not quarantine.</p><p>The state is providing vaccines and technical support, but the response is being led by the state health department. Measles cases have been concentrated in private school communities and rural towns, and hospital officials report that patients have needed oxygen tubes and intubation to treat respiratory issues.</p><p>
|</p><p>Vaccines are safe and effective against measles, which was considered eliminated in 2000. However, vaccination rates have declined nationwide, and most states are below the 95% threshold needed to protect communities against outbreaks. The disease can lead to complications such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling, and death, and most people will recover from it.</p> <a href='https://apnews.com/article/measles-outbreak-west-texas-death-rfk-41adc66641e4a56ce2b2677480031ab9' target="_blank">An unvaccinated child has died in the Texas measles outbreak - The Associated Press</a><br></p><hr><h2>A Mystery Disease Has Killed Dozens So Far in Northwestern Congo - Gizmodo</h2>

The World Health Organization has reported two clusters of cases, with at least 431 individuals sickened and 53 deaths attributed to the unknown illness, which began in January.</p><p>According to the latest cases, hemorrhaging and severe symptoms such as fever, vomiting, and abdominal pain have been reported, but initial tests have ruled out established suspects like Ebola and Marburg. The outbreak is particularly concerning as nearly half of the deaths have occurred within 48 hours, with a mortality rate of around 10%.</p><p>WHO officials are now conducting genetic testing and have sent extra medical supplies to the region to support local doctors in their efforts to identify the cause of the illness. Several possibilities, including malaria and viral hemorrhagic fever, are being explored, but further investigation is needed to determine the root cause of the outbreaks.</p><p>)</p><p>Experts warn that the limited medical resources and remote location of the affected villages are major challenges in fighting this outbreak. While bats, which are carriers of viruses, are a potential risk, the exact cause of the illness remains a mystery, and the world waits with bated breath as WHO officials work to contain the situation and find a solution.</p> <a href='https://gizmodo.com/a-mystery-disease-has-killed-dozens-so-far-in-northwestern-congo-2000568625' target="_blank">A Mystery Disease Has Killed Dozens So Far in Northwestern Congo - Gizmodo</a><br></p><hr><h2>Scientists discover a protein that reverses cellular aging - Earth.com</h2>

                </div>
            <p><p> </p><p>Researchers at Osaka University in Japan have made a breakthrough in understanding cellular aging, potentially leading to a genuine reversal of the aging process at a cellular level. By studying a specific protein called AP2A1, which is predominantly found in senescent cells, the researchers identified its role in maintaining the large size of these cells. Suppressing AP2A1 in older cells reversed senescence, promoting cellular rejuvenation, while overexpressing it in young cells accelerated senescence.</p><p>The study also highlighted the complex interaction between AP2A1 and another protein, integrin β1, which plays a crucial role in anchoring cells to their external surroundings. This interaction likely helps older cells maintain their oversized physical characteristics. The findings suggest that AP2A1 could be a promising target for medical interventions aimed at combating age-related diseases.</p><p>The identification of AP2A1 as a potential biomarker for aging and its role in promoting cellular rejuvenation opens up exciting possibilities for future treatments. By understanding and controlling cellular mechanisms like AP2A1, medicine could effectively reverse aging, potentially leading to significant advances in medicine and improvements in human health, longevity, and quality of life.</p> <a href='https://www.earth.com/news/scientists-discover-a-protein-that-reverses-cellular-aging/' target="_blank">Scientists discover a protein that reverses cellular aging - Earth.com</a><br></p><hr><h2>Eating This Fruit Every Day Can Reduce Depression Risk, Per Harvard Researchers - Women's Health</h2>

                </div>
            <p><p>Researchers have linked eating citrus fruits to a lower risk of depression. A study published in the BMC Microbiome journal analyzed data from over 32,000 participants and found that a daily serving of citrus reduced the risk of depression by about 20 percent.</p><p>The bacteria Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, found in the gut microbiome of citrus eaters, was more abundant in people who weren't depressed. The gut-brain axis, a communication system between the gut and brain, plays a crucial role in mental health, influencing the production of neurotransmitters and bodily inflammation.</p><p>
To reap the benefits, incorporating citrus into your daily diet is recommended, particularly for high-vitamin C fruits like oranges. Other fermented foods like yogurt and kimchi, as well as omega-3 rich nut and seeds, may also aid in maintaining a healthy gut-brain connection and lower depression risk.</p><p>
While the study's findings suggest a link between citrus and depression prevention, it's essential to note that citrus should not be considered a treatment for clinical major depression and instead be viewed as a dietary choice that can potentially support overall mental well-being.</p> <a href='https://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/a63917947/orange-citrus-depression-study/' target="_blank">Eating This Fruit Every Day Can Reduce Depression Risk, Per Harvard Researchers - Women's Health</a><br></p><hr><h2>The Bird Flu Could Be Way Worse Than We Know, According to Experts - Yahoo</h2>

            <p><p>)</p><p>A new variant of the H5N1 strain of avian influenza, also known as bird flu, has been found in cows and a dairy worker in the United States. According to Tulane University, this variant, known as D1.1, was previously only found in wild birds and domestic poultry, but has now also been detected in cattle and human cases. This finding may signal a change in the way the virus is spreading, potentially making it harder to contain.</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported a significant number of flu cases, hospitalizations, and deaths this winter, with at least 33 million illnesses, 430,000 hospitalizations, and 19,000 deaths reported so far. Experts warn that the potential for the virus to reassort with other strains is high, potentially leading to a more widespread outbreak. </p><p>To protect yourself from bird flu, experts recommend cooking eggs and meat thoroughly, avoiding raw milk and unpasteurized cheese, and washing your hands frequently if you come into contact with farm animals. If you haven't received a flu shot this year, consider getting one to protect against seasonal influenza.</p> <a href='https://www.foodandwine.com/avian-influenza-transmission-endemic-in-cows-11686288' target="_blank">The Bird Flu Could Be Way Worse Than We Know, According to Experts - Yahoo</a><br></p><hr><h2>Dementia risk could increase with low levels of essential vitamin - AOL</h2>

            <p><p>)</p><p>
Researchers at the University of California San Francisco conducted a study on 231 healthy older adults and found that normal levels of vitamin B12 may not be enough to ward off dementia. The participants had B12 levels averaging 414.8 pmol/L, while the recommended minimum level in the US is just 148 pmol/L. Those with lower levels had "slower cognitive and visual processing speeds," and more lesions in the white matter of their brains, which can be a warning sign of cognitive decline.</p><p>
The researchers recommend updating the current B12 requirements, noting that previous studies may have missed subtle functional manifestations of high or low B12 levels that can affect people without causing overt symptoms. They suggest that clinicians consider supplementation in older patients with neurological symptoms even if their levels are within normal limits.</p><p>
Experts, including a neurosurgeon and longevity expert, suggest that "normal" vitamin B12 levels are "grossly inadequate" for protecting the brain from age-related decline. They recommend updating the current B12 requirements and suggest that supplementation may be beneficial for certain individuals, but caution against taking "mega-doses" of vitamins.</p> <a href='https://www.foxnews.com/health/dementia-risk-could-increase-low-levels-essential-vitamin' target="_blank">Dementia risk could increase with low levels of essential vitamin - AOL</a><br></p><hr></div>
