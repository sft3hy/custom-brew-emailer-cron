            <p><p>A new study suggests that eating from plastic takeout containers, even for short periods, may increase the risk of congestive heart failure.  Researchers found that rats who consumed water boiled in plastic containers showed heart damage and changes in their gut biome.  </p><p>The study, published in Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety, monitored rats over three months and found  damage regardless of how long the water was boiled in the plastic. Interestingly,  the researchers observed changes in the gut microbiota and metabolites linked to inflammation and oxidative stress in the rats.   </p><p>These findings highlight  the potential dangers of plastic leaching into food and  suggest that using alternatives to plastic containers, especially for hot foods, might be beneficial for cardiovascular health.  </p><p></p><p></p> <a href='https://people.com/eating-from-plastic-takeout-containers-can-cause-extensive-heart-damage-11681064' target="_blank">Eating from Plastic Takeout Containers Can Cause ‘Extensive’ Heart Damage, Increase Risk of Cardiovascular Disease - AOL</a><br></p><hr><h2>Doctor warns 'early' sign of dementia appears when watching TV - what to look out for - Daily Express US</h2>

                </div>
            <p><p>A dementia expert, Dr. Tim Rittman, is raising awareness about early signs of the disease, which may be subtle and easily mistaken for other issues.  He highlights that issues with memory and concentration can emerge during everyday activities, such as watching television. For example, someone in the early stages of dementia might struggle to remember what happened earlier in the day, repeat questions frequently, or find it difficult to follow a TV show's plot. </p><p> 
It's important to note that these early symptoms can also be caused by other factors, such as stress or medications. However, Dr. Rittman stresses the importance of being aware of these signs and seeking medical advice if you notice them in yourself or a loved one. </p><p>
Early diagnosis of dementia allows individuals and their families to make informed plans, access appropriate care, and explore research opportunities. </p><p></p><p></p> <a href='https://www.the-express.com/news/health/164100/doctor-warns-early-sign-dementia-appears-watching-tv' target="_blank">Doctor warns 'early' sign of dementia appears when watching TV - what to look out for - Daily Express US</a><br></p><hr><h2>Want To Prevent Dementia?
