            <p><p>Astronomers have discovered a massive new structure in the universe called Quipu, a collection of 68 galaxy clusters extending over 1.4 billion light-years. This discovery makes Quipu the largest known cosmic structure, surpassing the previous record holder, the Sloan Great Wall.  </p><p>The researchers found Quipu by analyzing data from the ROSAT X-ray satellite, which allows them to map the distribution of galaxy clusters. The name Quipu is inspired by the intricate knotted cords used by the Incas to record information,  reflecting the complexity and vastness of this cosmic structure.</p><p>Quipu's existence challenges the cosmological principle, which suggests the universe appears uniform across large scales. This finding highlights the vastness and complexity of the universe and emphasizes that our understanding of cosmic structure is constantly evolving. Future observations will likely reveal even more about this remarkable discovery and help us refine our models of the universe.  </p><p>

            <p><p>China's space agency is developing the China Space Station Telescope (CSST), a powerful new observatory designed to rival the James Webb Space Telescope.  CSST, also known as Xuntian, will boast advanced optics granting it a field of view 300 times greater than Hubble's, and will operate across ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths.</p><p>Scheduled for launch no earlier than 2026, CSST will join a group of cutting-edge telescopes, including the Euclid, Roman, and Vera C. Rubin observatories.  These telescopes share a common goal: to unveil cosmic mysteries through deep-space surveys.</p><p>CSST's capabilities will enable measurements of weak gravitational lensing, providing insights into dark matter distribution. It will also  study cosmic voids and galaxy clusters to shed light on dark energy. Furthermore, CSST will hunt for supernovas and  examine baryon acoustic oscillations, both crucial for understanding the universe's evolution.</p><p></p><p>With its orbit shared with the Tiangong space station, CSST will have the unique ability to be serviced, upgraded, and potentially operate for decades, marking a significant advancement in space-based astronomy.

            <p><p>NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has revealed a surprisingly active central region in our Milky Way galaxy.  </p><p>New observations show that Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the galaxy's core, is constantly experiencing bursts and flares of light. These bursts vary in size and duration, happening every few hours as hot gas in the accretion disk surrounding the black hole is disrupted.  </p><p>Scientists believe the flares are triggered by turbulence in the accretion disk, similar to solar flares, and by powerful magnetic reconnection events. These findings provide unique insights into the dynamic processes happening near a black hole and could help researchers better understand these enigmatic objects. </p><p></p><p>

This drug could be life-saving for people with metabolic diseases like Leigh syndrome, which is characterized by the body's inability to use oxygen efficiently. </p><p>HypoxyStat works by mimicking the body's natural adaptation to high altitudes, where oxygen levels are lower.  Studies in mice with Leigh syndrome showed that HypoxyStat significantly reduced brain damage, extended lifespan, and even reversed existing damage. </p><p>This innovative drug offers a potential solution for patients who cannot move to high-altitude environments, providing a controlled and safe way to access the therapeutic benefits of low oxygen.  Researchers are now working on a next-generation version of the drug for further testing in primates and potential human trials. </p><p></p><p></p> <a href='https://www.sciencealert.com/this-new-drug-mimics-the-health-effects-of-living-at-high-altitude' target="_blank">This New Drug Mimics The Health Effects of Living at High Altitude - ScienceAlert</a><br></p><hr><h2>Colorado physicists unveil groundbreaking breath sensor for disease detection - 9News.com KUSA</h2>

            <p><p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has captured an image of Leo P, a dwarf galaxy 5.3 million light-years away, revealing a surprising resurgence of star formation. This diminutive galaxy, largely composed of hydrogen and helium, is believed to be a pristine example of how galaxies formed in the early universe. Its isolation from other galaxies has allowed it to retain its original characteristics, making it a valuable subject for studying galaxy evolution.</p><p>What makes Leo P particularly remarkable is its unexpected revival of star birth after a long period of dormancy. This is unusual for dwarf galaxies, which often cease forming stars due to a lack of necessary materials.  JWST's image shows clusters of bright blue stars, indicating recent star formation, as well as a bubble-like structure of ionized hydrogen, further confirming this phenomenon.</p><p>Scientists believe Leo P went through phases of initial star formation, followed by a lengthy dormancy, and now a third phase of renewed star formation. This unique history offers insights into the early universe and the role of dwarf galaxies.  Its ancient composition and isolated location make it a time capsule, providing clues about the conditions present during the Epoch of Reionization, a crucial period in cosmic history when the first stars and galaxies began shaping the universe. </p><p></p><p></p> <a href='https://indiandefencereview.com/james-webb-telescope-dwarf-galaxy/' target="_blank">James Webb Telescope Unveils a Mysterious Dwarf Galaxy That Shouldn’t Exist - Indian Defence Review</a><br></p><hr></div>
