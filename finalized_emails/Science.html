A remarkable discovery has shed light on the resilience of life, revealing that even tiny organisms can survive for tens of thousands of years trapped in ice. Scientists at the University of Cologne successfully thawed and revived a 46,000-year-old nematode worm, dubbed Panagrolaimus kolymaensis, using a process called cryptobiosis. This phenomenon, where all metabolic processes stop, allows certain organisms to pause life, challenging our understanding of survival strategies in nature.</p><p>)</p><p>
The worm's ability to halt biological activity under extreme conditions has scientists excited about its potential implications for advancing cryobiology, genetics, and even space exploration. The unique molecules protecting its cells from dehydration and freezing may hold the key to understanding and replicating this process, paving the way for breakthroughs in medical science, space travel, and food storage. The discovery has opened doors to groundbreaking research, with possibilities ranging from extending human organ viability to preserving entire ecosystems for long-term storage.</p> <a href='https://indiandefencereview.com/scientists-revive-a-46000-year-old-worm/' target="_blank">Frozen in Time: Scientists Revive a 46,000-Year-Old Worm From Siberian Permafrost - Indian Defence Review</a><br></p><hr><h2>NASA's asteroid-hopping Lucy probe takes 1st images of its next target: Donaldjohanson - Space.com</h2>

NASA's Lucy spacecraft is heading towards its next target: the asteroid 52246 Donaldjohanson, with a flyby planned for April 20. The spacecraft has already visited another asteroid, Dinkinesh, and before that, its long-range imager captured images of the asteroid Donaldjohanson from 45 million miles away. Lucy will get a close-up look of the asteroid soon, coming within 596 miles of its surface as it orbits between Mars and Jupiter. The encounter is not just a thrill ride for scientists - it also provides a chance to uncover more about the asteroid's structure and its place in the early days of the solar system.</p><p>
')</p><p>
The Lucy spacecraft's journey is far from over. In 2027, it will make its first encounter with a Trojan asteroid, and by 2030, it will leave Earth to receive a gravitational slingshot towards Jupiter's L5 point. The Trojans, located at the Lagrange points 60 degrees ahead and behind Jupiter, offer a unique opportunity to explore asteroids that date back to the early solar system. By visiting these asteroids, Lucy will help unravel the mysteries of our cosmic neighborhood, just as its namesake, Lucy, helped decipher the secrets of human evolution.</p> <a href='https://www.space.com/space-exploration/asteroid-comet-missions/nasas-asteroid-hopping-lucy-probe-takes-1st-images-of-its-next-target-donaldjohanson' target="_blank">NASA's asteroid-hopping Lucy probe takes 1st images of its next target: Donaldjohanson - Space.com</a><br></p><hr><h2>The ‘Elegant’ Math Model That Could Help Rescue Coral Reefs - Quanta Magazine</h2>

            <p><p>Eva Llabrés has always been drawn to the ocean, and as a child, she spent countless hours snorkeling in the Mediterranean, marveling at its diverse marine life. But it wasn't until she turned to physics and math in college that she uncovered a new set of mysteries to uncover in the ocean. Specifically, she became fascinated with the complex and contradictory nature of coral - a towering, structured entity that also consists of tiny, individual polyps.</p><p>Llabrés, a physicist-turned-oceanographer, set out to crack the code of coral growth, using her mathematical expertise to develop a computer model that simulates how polyps build complex structures. In a recent study, she and her team made significant headway towards a universal model of coral growth, one that can predict the five most common shapes of coral structures using just five growth variables.</p><p>This breakthrough has profound implications for coral researchers and conservation efforts. By understanding how corals grow and change, scientists can use computer models to guide their efforts to restore damaged reefs and rebuild entire ecosystems. Llabrés' work is a testament to the power of interdisciplinary collaboration, combining biology, math, and computer science to unlock the secrets of the ocean's most fascinating creatures.</p><p> </p><p>With this model, researchers can now better understand the intricate processes that shape coral reefs, from the local environmental conditions to the individual behaviors of polyps. This knowledge can help inform conservation efforts and support the restoration of damaged reefs, which are essential for the health of our planet's oceans.</p> <a href='https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-elegant-math-model-that-could-help-rescue-coral-reefs-20250226/' target="_blank">The ‘Elegant’ Math Model That Could Help Rescue Coral Reefs - Quanta Magazine</a><br></p><hr><h2>Today's Stacked SpaceX Launch Is Sending Groundbreaking Science to the Moon and Beyond - Gizmodo</h2>

Astronomers have made a groundbreaking discovery, directly observing two exoplanets shedding their outer layers into space for the first time. K2-22b, a Neptune-size rocky world, is losing its surface due to its star's intense heat, while BD+054868Ab, a smaller exoplanet, is evaporating at an alarming rate. The latter's tails are thought to span nearly 9 million kilometers, offering a unique glimpse into the interiors of these distant worlds.</p><p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has provided the means to study the composition of these evaporating planets, revealing gases like carbon dioxide and nitric oxide that are typically associated with icy bodies. Scientists believe that K2-22b may have originated farther from its star and migrated inward, while BD+054868Ab is expected to cease to exist in 1-2 million years.</p><p>These observations offer unprecedented insights into the internal structures of planets beyond our solar system, and astronomers are astonished by the rate at which BD+054868Ab is evaporating.
