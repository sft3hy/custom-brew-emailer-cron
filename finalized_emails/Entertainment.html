Despite ongoing legal troubles, Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds put on a united front at the "Saturday Night Live" 50th anniversary special in New York. The couple, both sporting glamorous attire, radiated smiles and laughter as they posed for cameras, seemingly unfazed by the drama surrounding their legal dispute with director Justin Baldoni.

Earlier this month, Lively filed a lawsuit against Baldoni, alleging sexual harassment and a subsequent “social manipulation” campaign orchestrated by his representatives to damage her reputation. Baldoni vehemently denies these allegations and has filed his own counter-suits against Lively, Reynolds, and others involved.  The highly publicized feud continues to unfold, with a trial date set for March 2026.

Kendrick Lamar's "GNX" reclaims its place at the top of the Billboard 200 albums chart for a second consecutive week.  The surge follows his electrifying Super Bowl halftime show and the release of the album on physical formats.  This successful return to the top spot propelled Lamar to a historic achievement – he's now the first rap artist to have three albums simultaneously in the Billboard 200 top 10.

Both "DAMN." and "good kid, m.A.A.d city" also soared in the charts, landing at number 9 and 10 respectively.  The feat makes Lamar the first living male artist to accomplish this since Herb Alpert in 1966, and just the second act overall to boast this level of chart dominance behind Taylor Swift. In addition to charting high, "GNX" broke digital sales records, with vinyl sales totalling a remarkable 87,000, Lamar's best week ever on the format.


With a combined 236,000 equivalent album units earned, "GNX" demonstrates the power of Lamar's Super Bowl performance and the public's enduring love for his music.  "DAMN." saw a 93% increase in activity, while "good kid, m.A.A.d city" gained a 71% boost, solidifying Lamar's ongoing dominance in the music industry.
