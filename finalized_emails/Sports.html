            <p><p>Dmitry Bivol reclaimed the WBA light heavyweight title in a close majority decision victory over Artur Beterbiev in a rematch of their disputed fight from earlier this year. </p><p>Bivol looked stronger and more confident throughout the fight, landing more punches and demonstrating excellent defense. He consistently countered Beterbiev's pressure and controlled the pace, particularly in the later rounds. While Beterbiev landed some hard shots and displayed his power, he couldn't overcome Bivol's improved efficiency and stamina. </p><p>The judges scored the fight 114-114, 116-112, and 115-113 for Bivol, marking a reversal from their first meeting where a disputed decision went in Beterbiev's favor. The victory sets the stage for a potential trilogy fight, which fans are eager to see. </p><p></p><p>The undercard featured several other exciting bouts, including Joseph Parker's second-round TKO win over Martin Bakole in a heavyweight clash and Shakur Stevenson's ninth-round TKO victory against Josh Padley in the WBC lightweight title defense.   </p><p></p> <a href='https://www.cbssports.com/boxing/news/artur-beterbiev-vs-dmitry-bivol-2-fight-results-live-boxing-updates-highlights-scorecard-start-time/live/' target="_blank">Artur Beterbiev vs. Dmitry Bivol 2 fight results: Live boxing updates, highlights, scorecard, start time - CBS Sports</a><br></p><hr><h2>Matthew Stafford to Giants, Aaron Rodgers to Rams? - NBC Sports</h2>

            <p><p>This year's Scouting Combine is generating lots of buzz about potential trades, especially for star quarterbacks Matthew Stafford and Aaron Rodgers. One experienced general manager predicts that Stafford will be dealt to the Giants, while Rodgers will land with the Rams. </p><p>The theory suggests that Stafford could be seeking a raise and the Giants might be willing to make a big splash to improve their chances of winning now. Rodgers, meanwhile, is reportedly interested in playing for the Rams and may be willing to accept a discounted deal to make the move.</p><p>This potential shakeup could see both quarterbacks playing for new teams in 2025, marking a new chapter in their careers. </p><p></p><p></p> <a href='https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/matthew-stafford-to-giants-aaron-rodgers-to-rams' target="_blank">Matthew Stafford to Giants, Aaron Rodgers to Rams? - NBC Sports</a><br></p><hr><h2>Alex Bregman-Rafael Devers saga among most challenging in long history of stars’ position changes - New York Post </h2>

            <p><p>Trading established players can lead to interesting team dynamics. Sometimes, the transition is smooth, like when Alex Rodriguez moved to third base for the Yankees, allowing Derek Jeter to remain at shortstop.  </p><p>However,  other times, the switch can be bumpy.  The Mets' acquisition of Mike Piazza in 1998 led to conflict when Todd Hundley lost his starting catcher role while injured. Despite returning to the team, Hundley struggled in left field, leading to his departure shortly after. </p><p></p><p></p> <a href='https://nypost.com/2025/02/22/sports/alex-bregman-rafael-devers-position-saga-among-most-challenging/' target="_blank">Alex Bregman-Rafael Devers saga among most challenging in long history of stars’ position changes - New York Post </a><br></p><hr><h2>India and Pakistan’s rivalry reignites in Dubai at Champions Trophy: Match Preview - ICC Cricket</h2>

            <p><p>The Cleveland Cavaliers delivered a dominant 142-105 victory over the New York Knicks, showcasing their maturation as a team.  Friday's win serves as a stark contrast to their previous playoff series against the Knicks, where they fell short. The Cavs have significantly improved their offensive firepower and defensive prowess since then, solidifying their position as contenders in the Eastern Conference.</p><p>Donovan Mitchell and Darius Garland highlighted the Cavs' growth, demonstrating their scoring prowess and leadership on both ends of the court. Evan Mobley has emerged as a dominant force in the paint, while young players like Dean Wade, Isaac Okoro, Max Strus, and Ty Jerome have contributed significantly to their success.</p><p>The Knicks, on the other hand, appeared outmatched and lackluster. Their reliance on a perimeter-oriented offense failed to materialize against the Cavs' suffocating defense, leaving them struggling to keep up with Cleveland's high-powered attack. The Cavs' triumph proved that they are no longer the same team that suffered a disappointing defeat at the hands of the Knicks two years ago, and they are poised to make a serious impact in the upcoming playoffs.</p><p></p><p></p> <a href='https://www.cleveland.com/cavs/2025/02/cavs-freaky-friday-moment-vs-knicks-tears-outdated-playoff-narrative-to-shreds-jimmy-watkins.html' target="_blank">Cavs Freaky Friday moment vs. Knicks tears outdated playoff narrative to shreds — Jimmy Watkins - cleveland.com</a><br></p><hr><h2>Steph Curry reaches historic scoring milestone as Warriors continue post-trade deadline improvement - CNN</h2>

Butler contributed 17 points, seven assists, and three rebounds in the win over the Kings.</p><p>Curry acknowledges the importance of the second half of the season for the team.

                </div>
            <p><p>San Francisco 49ers linebacker De'Vondre Campbell abruptly left the team during a game in Week 15, leading to his suspension for the remainder of the season. </p><p>Campbell's reason for this walkout remained unclear until he took to social media, where he expressed indifference to the situation. He implied that he's comfortable with life outside of football, stating he's "rich" and "never have to work another day of my life." </p><p>Campbell's actions seem to stem from dissatisfaction over losing his starting position to Dre Greenlaw. The linebacker was a key player last season but was ultimately benched when Greenlaw recovered from an Achilles injury. It remains to be seen if any NFL team will welcome Campbell back after his shocking behavior. </p><p>
