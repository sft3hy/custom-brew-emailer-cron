                </div>
            <p><p>)</p><p>The NFL Players Association released its annual survey, revealing significant improvements in the working conditions of teams across the league. The Washington Commanders, ranked 32nd last year, rose to 11th place this year, with changes implemented by new owner Josh Harris. Coach Dan Quinn, the league's most-liked coach, took the Commanders to a 12-5 record and an NFC title game appearance in his debut year.</p><p>In contrast, the New York Jets, ranked 21st last year, slipped to 29th, with players citing concerns over team owner Woody Johnson's investment, positive culture, and competitive team building. Johnson initially reacted emotionally to requests for change but later incorporated some improvements. The survey also highlighted the importance of treatment of families, with 27 teams offering daycare free of charge and only three teams not providing this benefit.</p><p>)</p><p>Improvements were seen across the league, with 41% more players awarding grades of at least A-minus this year than last, and only four areas receiving F-minuses. Teams such as the Kansas City Chiefs, Miami Dolphins, and Atlanta Falcons made significant strides in areas like food services, childcare, and travel accommodations. The union is also exploring ways to condense the survey timeline to minimize season-related noise in the data.</p><p>)</p><p>As for the teams at the bottom, the Arizona Cardinals received the lowest grades, while the New England Patriots, Cleveland Browns, Jets, and Pittsburgh Steelers rounded out the bottom eight. Team owners who graded lowest on perceived willingness to invest and contributing to positive team culture were those who ranked lowest in these areas. Despite these challenges, the union remains optimistic, stating that the survey has become less focused on 'dismantling walls and buildings' and more on addressing softer issues like treatment of families.</p> <a href='https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/article/nflpa-report-cards-2025-160018349.html' target="_blank">NFLPA report cards: Woody Johnson instills 'culture of fear' in Jets while Josh Harris improves Commanders - Yahoo Sports</a><br></p><hr><h2>Wolves reach 2-yr. deal with Clark, to add Hyland - ESPN</h2>

            <p><p>)</p><p>The Baltimore Ravens general manager Eric DeCosta has publicly addressed the allegations of sexual misconduct against kicker Justin Tucker, with the team investigating the situation in tandem with the NFL. Tucker has accused six former massage therapists of making false allegations, but DeCosta calls the allegations "serious and concerning." The Ravens say they will wait for the findings of the investigation before making a decision about Tucker's future with the team.</p><p>Since the NFL had a similar investigation involving Deshaun Watson that also did not bring enough charges against the quarterback, the team's response is starting to come under scrutiny. The Ravens' head coach John Harbaugh said the team had a "zero-tolerance" policy for domestic violence and the team had consistently taken a firm stance but often leaving room to "take second chances". Maybe, maybe they will maintain those remarks, the policy remains unclear.</p><p>)</p> <a href='https://www.theringer.com/2025/02/26/nfl/justin-tucker-baltimore-ravens-sexual-misconduct-john-harbaugh-eric-decosta-zero-tolerance-nfl-combine' target="_blank">The Justin Tucker Situation Is a Test for the Baltimore Ravens’ “Zero-Tolerance” Policy - The Ringer</a><br></p><hr><h2>Luka Dončić posts first triple-double with Lakers as L.A. tops Mavericks in first meeting since trade - CBS Sports</h2>

However, despite his impressive performance, his night wasn't without controversy, as two of his shots were wiped off the board due to him stepping out of bounds.</p><p>Despite the initial awkwardness, Dončić showed improvement in several areas, including defense, holding the Mavericks to just 105.8 points per possession. His effort has caught the attention of teammate LeBron James, who led the team to a 107-99 victory, along with Austin Reaves scoring a career-best 19.2 points per game.</p><p>As Dončić settles into his new role with the Lakers, he's experiencing a change in pace compared to his old team in Dallas, where he was often the go-to scorer. Although he's not finding his footing yet, his teammates are making up for his scoring slumps, as seen in their last win over Charlotte.</p><p>Dončić acknowledged that it's a process, but for now, the Lakers' balanced offense is working in his favor, freeing him to focus on his defensive and playmaking duties. He expressed relief after the game, finally finding closure after a tough first night back on the court.</p> <a href='https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/luka-doncic-posts-first-triple-double-with-lakers-as-l-a-tops-mavericks-in-first-meeting-since-trade/' target="_blank">Luka Dončić posts first triple-double with Lakers as L.A. tops Mavericks in first meeting since trade - CBS Sports</a><br></p><hr></div>
