            <h2>Montas (lat strain) shut down by Mets for 6-8 weeks - MLB.com</h2>
            <p>
            <p>The New York Mets are facing an early challenge to their pitching depth. Frankie Montas, a key addition
                this offseason, suffered a high-grade right lat strain and is expected to be sidelined for 6-8 weeks.
                His injury throws a wrench in the Mets' plan to rely on a deep rotation, particularly as Montas was
                slated to be a significant contributor.</p>
            <p>Manager Carlos Mendoza remains optimistic, emphasizing the team's belief in their remaining options. A
                mix of veterans and newcomers like Kodai Senga, Sean Manaea, Clay Holmes, and David Peterson will be
                expected to step up and fill the void left by Montas.</p>
            <p>The Mets haven't ruled out a six-man rotation to preserve Senga's health and strategically manage their
                pitching staff. Paul Blackburn, Griffin Canning, and Tylor Megill are all vying for the remaining spots
                in the rotation, with Megill's minor league option giving him a potential advantage. </p>
            <p>Despite their depth, the Mets face questions marks about the health and consistency of their pitching
                staff. Montas' injury history adds to those concerns, leaving the team to hope that their pitching coach
                can work his magic and develop a strong rotation. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>The Mets' early season success hinges on their ability to overcome this setback and their pitching
                staff's ability to perform consistently.

            <h2>Everything Alex Cora Said About Rafael Devers Preferring To Retain Position - NESN</h2>
            <p>
            <p>Alex Cora had a direct conversation with Rafael Devers last week about his potential role on the Red Sox
                following the signing of Alex Bregman.</p>
            <p>Devers made it clear he wants to stay at third base, a stance Cora acknowledged. "He feels like he’s a
                third baseman," Cora said, emphasizing Devers' strong pride in his position. Cora stressed that the Red
                Sox's ultimate goal is to build the best possible team, and decisions will be made based on what
                benefits the team as a whole.</p>
            <p>While recognizing the competition, Cora indicated that the Red Sox wouldn't be making a decision about
                Devers or Bregman's positions just yet. He believes flexibility and versatility will be crucial to the
                team's success and plans to assess the situation further. </p>
            <p>Cora remained positive, emphasizing the strong relationship he has with Devers and assuring reporters
                that Devers ultimately wants to win a championship with the Red Sox.

            <h2>Jeff Gordon 'in full support' of William Byron breaking his records - FOX Sports</h2>
            <p>
            <p>William Byron made history at the Daytona 500, becoming the youngest driver to win the race twice. The
                27-year-old driver bested his competition and managed to win back-to-back Daytona 500s, even surpassing
                Jeff Gordon's record that stood for many years. Byron's victory also marked the ninth and tenth Daytona
                500 wins for Hendrick Motorsports, further solidifying the team's place in NASCAR history.</p>
            <p>While team owner Rick Hendrick watched the race from home due to a rain delay, he returned in time to
                celebrate Byron's triumph. Despite missing the race in person, Hendrick expressed his delight with
                Byron's achievement and acknowledged the significance of breaking one of Gordon's cherished records.
            </p>
            <p>Byron's rise to the top has been impressive. He won an Xfinity championship at just 19 years old and has
                already secured 14 career victories in the Cup Series. His crew chief, Rudy Fugle, plays a crucial role
                in Byron's success, having forged a strong partnership with the driver since their time together at JR
                Motorsports. </p>
            <p>Byron's growth as a driver has been remarkable, particularly his comfort behind the wheel of the renowned
                No. 24 car previously driven by Jeff Gordon. He recognizes the immense pressure that comes with driving
                such a legendary car but now feels confident and part of a team building its own unique legacy.</p>
            <p>
                Byron's Daytona 500 victory was a particularly memorable one, achieved through a dramatic last-lap
                incident where several cars ahead of him crashed, allowing Byron to surge forward and claim the win.
                Gordon, acknowledging the improbable nature of the victory, joked that Byron and his team must be
                "living right."

                Sports</h2>
            <p>
            <p>Auburn remains the top team in the nation, holding onto the No. 1 spot in the AP Top 25 poll for the
                sixth consecutive week. The Tigers earned all but one first-place vote after defeating No. 2 Alabama on
                the road, solidifying their dominant position in the SEC. Florida soared to No. 2, their highest ranking
                since 2014, following victories over previously ranked Mississippi State and South Carolina.</p>
            <p>Alabama, meanwhile, dropped to No. 4 after their loss to Auburn. The SEC continues to dominate the top

                10, with five teams included, and three of the top four spots. </p>
            <p>Duke, tied with Florida for No. 3 last week, now stands alone at No. 3. The Blue Devils extend their
                streak in the top five to 11 weeks, achieving a perfect week with wins against Cal and Stanford. </p>
            <p>The rest of the Top 10 showcases a mix of strong SEC contenders and teams from other prominent
                conferences. Houston holds steady at No. 5 while Tennessee remains at No. 6. Texas A&M and Iowa State
                occupy spots 7 and 8 respectively, followed by Texas Tech at No. 9. St. John's rounds out the top 10.
            </p>
            <p>.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>Louisville returns to the Top 25 after a two-week absence, landing at No. 25. The Cardinals have been on
